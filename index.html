    <h2>Part 4: Twin System â€” Opposing Energies</h2>
    <p>We are born into a snare with two opposing spirits â€” a twin system. This is the mystery revealed throughout Scripture. From the beginning, there has been enmity between two seedlines, a war within the temple, and opposing forces within man: light and darkness, male and female, good and evil. These energies reflect the inner war that Paul speaks of in Romans 7 â€” the flesh striving against the spirit.</p>
    <p>Cain and Abel were twins born of two different fathers: one of God, the other of the serpent. Cain represents the carnal, earthly energy â€” the one who brought death into the field. Abel represents righteousness â€” the spiritual man, the image of Christ. The entire world system follows the Cain model: competition, envy, dominance, pride. The Kingdom of God follows the Abel pattern: humility, meekness, obedience, and sacrifice.</p>
    <p>Jesus teaches us in <strong>Matthew 13:38</strong> that "the field is the world." That means when Cain spilled Abelâ€™s blood in the field, it is a spiritual representation of death entering the world through envy and rebellion. Similarly, Judas â€” whose name is derived from Judah â€” betrayed Jesus, the Lion of the Tribe of Judah. That betrayal took place in the world (the field), and after selling out Christ, Judas died in the <strong>Field of Blood</strong> â€” a perfect mirror of humanity betraying its inheritance and losing its life.</p>
    <p>The very fact that Judas shares the same name as the tribe from which Jesus came emphasizes the deep spiritual truth: we come from God, and yet in our unconverted state, we betray Him. But through repentance and rebirth, the Lion of Judah restores us. That field, once soaked in blood, becomes a place of resurrection through Christ.</p>
    <p>This is echoed in ancient symbols like the Yin and Yang â€” not as new-age ideas, but as representations of the dual nature in the flesh. Male and female, light and dark â€” not physical gender, but spiritual coding in a fallen system. Only in Christ are these two opposing energies reconciled. He makes the two one. He breaks down the middle wall of partition.</p>
    <p>As long as we remain double-minded and unconverted, we are in a constant war within ourselves. But through the Holy Spirit, Christ removes the corrupt seed and replaces it with the incorruptible. That is the mystery of the new birth. That is what brings peace â€” the good you and the bad you are reconciled into one new creature.</p>
