    <h2>Part 1: Fundamentals and Scripture</h2>
    <p>This world is inverted. People are so programmed from birth that most ignore the Bible fundamentals. Take them to heart. The devil lies and runs the kingdoms of earth. Jesus is Truth. Ask, Seek, Knock â€” Daniel 2 says God is the revealer of secrets.</p>

      <strong>Matthew 4:8â€“9</strong><br />"Again, the devil taketh him up into an exceeding high mountain, and sheweth him all the kingdoms of the world..."

    <h2>Part 2: The Devil's Rule</h2>
    <p>Contemplate this scripture. The devil runs the kingdoms of the earth, even though the Lord God owns it all. The tenants of earth killed God's Son and the prophets. They are a rebellious house and judgment is coming to them.</p>
    <div class="verse">
      <strong>Matthew 4:8â€“9</strong><br />

    </div>
    <p>Listen to Jesus' words and join the dots. A crime syndicate led by the fallen angel Lucifer runs the kingdoms of earth. The God of truth in His kindness is making them obvious to us in these last days. Everything is coming to light.</p>

    <h2>Part 3: Wheat and Tares</h2>
    <p>Read Matthew 13:24â€“30. Once you understand there are two races (in our temple and on the earth), you can start to grasp why we are a kingdom divided. And why the ruling class hate us and lie to us. We may all look the same on the outside, but inside there is something different. Jesus said you will know them by their fruit â€” do they lie? Do they honor the Father and the Son?</p>

    <h2>Part 4: Two Powers</h2>
    <p>Earth is in the middle, with the Lord God of truth above, and the devil of lies below. Want to win? Then trust in Jesus and not in men.</p>

    <h2>Part 5: Genesis & Elohim</h2>
    <p>In Genesis 1 the Lord God Almighty is not mentioned. The Hebrew word for God (H430) is 'Elohim' â€” plural, meaning gods, angels, and magistrates of the Supreme God. The Lord God is only mentioned in Genesis 2 when He forms Adam, the first man with a living soul.</p>
    <p>Genesis 2:2 says "God (Elohim) ended His work (deputyship) and rested." Ask yourself, would the Lord God Almighty be the Deputy? No, He'd be the Sheriff. Would He need rest? No, but Elohim, now in flesh, might need a rest.</p>

  </section>  <section id="part6">
    <h2>Part 6: Immanuel & El</h2>
    <p>Hebrew word 'El H410' is a name for Almighty God. Many biblical names end in 'El' including Immanuel (meaning God with us). A virgin shall conceive and bear a son. His name shall be called Immanuel. This name is our hope.</p>

    <h2>Part 7: Inversion</h2>
    <p>We are born into an inverted world. The truth is hidden from us by inversion and lies â€” Satanâ€™s conspiracy to hunt the souls of men. To see the hidden world, you must flip the world upside down.</p>
    <div class="verse">

    <h2>Part 8: Conversion Mystery</h2>
    <p>We are born into a snare with two opposing spirits â€” a twin system. Jesus came to seek the lost and mend the brokenhearted. Ask, Seek, Knock â€” ask to be made whole again.</p>
    <p>2 Timothy 2 says some oppose themselves. We are double-minded, and only through Christ can the connection to the pit (the worm that never dies) be cut â€” a spiritual circumcision. The eye that leads to destruction must be cut spiritually.</p>
    <p>Jesus said to Peter: "Flesh and blood hath not revealed it unto thee, but my Father which is in heaven." We cannot be made right with God by anything we do. Conversion is a divine accomplishment. Thank you Jesus, and thank you Jonathan Kleck â€” a harbinger of the end times. Visit <a href="https://kleckfiles.com" target="_blank">kleckfiles.com</a>.</p>
