  <h2>Part 1: Fundamentals and Scripture</h2>
  <p>This world is inverted. People are so programmed from birth that most ignore the Bible fundamentals. But it’s not simply ignorance — the truth is only revealed by the LORD. As Jesus told Peter, "flesh and blood hath not revealed it unto thee, but my Father which is in heaven" (Matthew 16:17). Only the LORD can open eyes and hearts to see who Christ truly is. Jesus Christ is the way, the truth, and the life. No one comes to the Father but through Him (John 14:6). Daniel 2 reminds us that God is the revealer of secrets — and He is lifting the veil in these last days.</p>  <div class="verse">
