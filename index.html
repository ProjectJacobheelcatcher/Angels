    <h2>Part 1: Fundamentals and Scripture</h2>
    <p>This world is inverted. People are programmed from birth to ignore the truth of God's Word. The Bible reveals the war weâ€™re in: light versus darkness, truth versus deception. God is the revealer of secrets â€” ask, seek, knock. Genesis 1 speaks of Elohim (plural), while Genesis 2 introduces the Lord God (YHWH Elohim), who forms Adam. There's a hidden story in the creation narrative, one of two seeds: the corruptible and the incorruptible.</p><p>Genesis 3:22 reveals that man became as one of "us" â€” speaking again to the plural. This connects to the war of the seeds in Genesis 3:15, where enmity is declared between the serpent's seed and the woman's seed. Revelation 12:17 and 21:17 reaffirm this hidden genetic and spiritual truth: a hybrid species of heavenly and fallen beings. Egypt is a picture of this world â€” it represents bondage, and we must be led out by the Spirit, not religion.</p>

    <h2>Part 4: Twin System â€” Opposing Energies</h2>
    <p>We are born into a twin system â€” two opposing spiritual energies within a single body. Itâ€™s Cain and Abel. Itâ€™s light and dark. Itâ€™s the good you and the bad you. One energy is from heaven, the other from the pit. The field Cain brought death into represents the world. When Judas betrayed Jesus, he too died in a field â€” the Field of Blood. These are echoes of our betrayal when we turned from God and killed ourselves spiritually.</p><p>This is why Jesus was crucified between two men: one represented the redeemed spirit, the other the fallen one. He stood in the middle to reconcile both halves. The whole system is inverted â€” and only through Christ can we be made whole again. When we're born again, the corruptible seed is replaced with the incorruptible. The locust from the pit loses its attachment. The connection is cut.</p>
