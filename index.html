  <h2>Part 1: Fundamentals and Scripture</h2>
  <p>This world is inverted. People are so programmed from birth that most ignore the Bible fundamentals. But it’s not simply ignorance — the truth is only revealed by the LORD. As Jesus told Peter, "flesh and blood hath not revealed it unto thee, but my Father which is in heaven" (Matthew 16:17). Only the LORD can open eyes and hearts to see who Christ truly is. Jesus Christ is the way, the truth, and the life. No one comes to the Father but through Him (John 14:6). Daniel 2 reminds us that God is the revealer of secrets — and He is lifting the veil in these last days.</p>  <div class="verse">

  <h2>Part 2: The Devil is a Liar — and Runs the Kingdoms of the World</h2>
  <p>
    The devil is the father of lies and has been a deceiver from the beginning. He offered Jesus all the kingdoms of the world because they are under his control — for now. Jesus rejected him, revealing the truth. Most of the world is blind to this reality because God has not revealed it to them yet.
    As Jesus said to Peter, "<strong>flesh and blood hath not revealed it unto thee, but my Father which is in heaven</strong>" (Matthew 16:17). 
    Paul also wrote, "<strong>the god of this world hath blinded the minds of them which believe not</strong>" (2 Corinthians 4:4).
    Only the LORD can open spiritual eyes.
  </p>

  <div class="verse">
    <strong>Matthew 4:8–9</strong><br />

  <h2>Part 3: Two Races — Wheat and Tares (Matthew 13)</h2>
  <p>
    Jesus taught in parables to reveal spiritual truth to those with ears to hear. In Matthew 13, He reveals a hidden truth: two spiritual lineages exist on earth — one from God (wheat) and one sown by the enemy (tares). They grow together until the harvest — the end of the world.
  </p>
  <p>
    These two types look similar outwardly, but their fruit — their actions — prove their source. This aligns with the mystery of Cain and Abel. One was righteous, the other not. Jesus said, “By their fruits ye shall know them” (Matthew 7:20). Ask: Do they lie? Do they honor Christ?
  </p>

  <div class="verse">
    <strong>Matthew 13:24–25</strong><br />
    "The kingdom of heaven is likened unto a man which sowed good seed in his field: But while men slept, his enemy came and sowed tares among the wheat, and went his way."

  <h2>Part 4: Two Great Powers — Christ Above, Satan Below</h2>
  <p>
    The battle is spiritual. Earth stands between two great spiritual forces: the Lord God above — the source of truth, light, and life — and the devil below — the ruler of lies, darkness, and death.
    This isn't symbolic. It's real. Most people are blind to it because they see only flesh. But scripture tells us clearly that our fight is against rulers of the darkness — not against people.
  </p>
  <p>
    The enemy uses systems, governments, media, education, and even religion to twist and suppress the truth. But God gives us the full armor of God so we can stand in the evil day. Victory is in Christ alone.
  </p>

  <div class="verse">
    <strong>Ephesians 6:10–12</strong><br />
    "Finally, my brethren, be strong in the Lord, and in the power of his might. Put on the whole armour of God, that ye may be able to stand against the wiles of the devil.
    For we wrestle not against flesh and blood, but against principalities, against powers, against the rulers of the darkness of this world, against spiritual wickedness in high places."

  <h2>Part 5: Genesis and the Mystery of Elohim</h2>
  <p>
    The book of Genesis reveals something hidden in plain sight. In Genesis 1, the Hebrew word used for “God” is <strong>“Elohim” (H430)</strong> — a plural term meaning “gods, angels, magistrates.” The “LORD God” (YHWH Elohim), the personal covenant name of the Most High, doesn’t appear until Genesis 2. This distinction is deliberate.
  </p>

  <p>
    Many believe Genesis 1 refers to the Supreme God, but the text suggests it speaks of delegated beings — Elohim. God allows His angels access to His power, and they can create under His authority. But not all remained loyal. Lucifer and the fallen made their own system — this world — as a counterfeit to God’s design.
  </p>

  <div class="verse">
    <strong>Genesis 1:1</strong><br />
    "In the beginning God <em>(Elohim)</em> created the heaven and the earth."
    <a href="https://classic.biblegateway.com/audio/mclean/kjv/Gen.1" target="_blank">🎧 Listen to Genesis 1</a>
  </div>

  <p>
    When Elohim created man in their image, the word “image” (H6754) implies a shadow or phantom — an idol, a vain show. But the LORD God (YHWH Elohim) did not form man with a soul until Genesis 2.
  </p>

  <div class="verse">
    <strong>Genesis 1:27</strong><br />
    "So God <em>(Elohim)</em> created man in his own image... male and female created he them."
    <a href="https://classic.biblegateway.com/audio/mclean/kjv/Gen.1" target="_blank">🎧 Listen to Genesis 1</a>
  </div>

  <div class="verse">
    <strong>Genesis 2:2</strong><br />
    "And on the seventh day God <em>(Elohim)</em> ended his work <em>(deputyship H4399)</em> which he had made; and he rested..."
    <a href="https://classic.biblegateway.com/audio/mclean/kjv/Gen.2" target="_blank">🎧 Listen to Genesis 2</a>
  </div>

  <p>
    When the “LORD God” forms man from the dust in Genesis 2:7, something changes — He breathes life into man and gives him a living soul. This is where true spiritual identity begins — not just a vessel made in the shadow of something greater, but a soul with divine breath.
  </p>

  <div class="verse">
    <strong>Genesis 2:7</strong><br />
    "And the LORD God formed man of the dust of the ground, and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life; and man became a living soul."

  <h2>Part 6: El, Immanuel, and the Name of God</h2>
  <p>
    Many names in the Bible carry God’s identity. The word <strong>“El” (H410)</strong> is a name for the Most High — the Almighty God. It’s embedded in names like <em>Emmanu-EL</em> (God with us), Dani-EL (God is my judge), and Micha-EL (Who is like God?). These names testify to the LORD’s presence and purpose.
  </p>

  <p>
    When Isaiah prophesied the virgin birth of Jesus, he said His name would be Immanuel. This means “God with us.” In the Gospel of Matthew, this prophecy is fulfilled — God came in the flesh. Christ is not just a teacher or prophet — He is El, the Almighty, walking among us.
  </p>

  <div class="verse">
    <strong>Isaiah 7:14</strong><br />
    "Therefore the Lord himself shall give you a sign; Behold, a virgin shall conceive, and bear a son, and shall call his name Immanuel."
    <a href="https://classic.biblegateway.com/audio/mclean/kjv/Isa.7" target="_blank">🎧 Listen to Isaiah 7</a>
  </div>

  <div class="verse">
    <strong>Matthew 1:23</strong><br />
    "Behold, a virgin shall be with child, and shall bring forth a son, and they shall call his name Emmanuel, which being interpreted is, God with us."
    <a href="https://classic.biblegateway.com/audio/mclean/kjv/Matt.1" target="_blank">🎧 Listen to Matthew 1</a>
  </div>

  <p>
    To know His name is to know His nature. He is the same LORD God who revealed Himself to Moses at the burning bush as <strong>I AM</strong> (Exodus 3:14), and who now calls us to Himself through Christ. Jesus said, “Before Abraham was, I am” (John 8:58), proving that He is one with El — eternal and uncreated.
  </p>

  <div class="verse">
    <strong>John 8:58</strong><br />
    "Jesus said unto them, Verily, verily, I say unto you, Before Abraham was, I am."
