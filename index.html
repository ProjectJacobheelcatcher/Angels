  <h2>Part 1: Fundamentals and Scripture</h2>
  <p>This world is inverted. People are so programmed from birth that most ignore the Bible fundamentals. But itâ€™s not simply ignorance â€” the truth is only revealed by the LORD. As Jesus told Peter, "flesh and blood hath not revealed it unto thee, but my Father which is in heaven" (Matthew 16:17). Only the LORD can open eyes and hearts to see who Christ truly is. Jesus Christ is the way, the truth, and the life. No one comes to the Father but through Him (John 14:6). Daniel 2 reminds us that God is the revealer of secrets â€” and He is lifting the veil in these last days.</p>  <div class="verse">

  <h2>Part 2: The Devil is a Liar â€” and Runs the Kingdoms of the World</h2>
  <p>
    The devil is the father of lies and has been a deceiver from the beginning. He offered Jesus all the kingdoms of the world because they are under his control â€” for now. Jesus rejected him, revealing the truth. Most of the world is blind to this reality because God has not revealed it to them yet.
    As Jesus said to Peter, "<strong>flesh and blood hath not revealed it unto thee, but my Father which is in heaven</strong>" (Matthew 16:17). 
    Paul also wrote, "<strong>the god of this world hath blinded the minds of them which believe not</strong>" (2 Corinthians 4:4).
    Only the LORD can open spiritual eyes.
