    <h2>Part 1: Fundamentals and Scripture</h2>
    <p>This world is inverted. People are so programmed from birth that most ignore the Bible fundamentals. Take them to heart. The devil lies and runs the kingdoms of earth. Jesus is Truth. Ask, Seek, Knock — Daniel 2 says God is the revealer of secrets.</p>

    <h2>Part 2: The Devil's Rule</h2>
    <p>Contemplate this scripture. The devil runs the kingdoms of the earth, even though the Lord God owns it all. The tenants of earth killed God's Son and the prophets. They are a rebellious house and judgment is coming to them.</p>

    <p>Listen to Jesus' words and join the dots. A crime syndicate led by the fallen angel Lucifer runs the kingdoms of earth. The God of truth in His kindness is making them obvious to us in these last days. Everything is coming to light.</p>

  <h2>Part 3: Wheat and Tares</h2>
  <p>Read Matthew 13:24–30. Once you understand there are two races (in our temple and on the earth), you can begin to grasp why we are a kingdom divided. And why the ruling class hate us and lie to us. We may all look the same on the outside, but inside there is something different. Jesus said you will know them by their fruit — do they lie? Do they honor the Father and the Son?</p>
  <p>Jesus explained that the wheat are the children of the kingdom, sown by the Son of Man, and the tares are the children of the wicked one, sown by the enemy. This powerful parable reveals not only the battle between good and evil but also a hidden mystery: that we, the wheat, are not merely human, but spiritual beings planted by God — angels in host bodies, foreknown before the foundation of the world.</p>
  <p>This division of seedlines originates in Genesis. God told Adam in Genesis 2:17 that eating from the Tree of the Knowledge of Good and Evil would bring death. Then in Genesis 3:15, God declares enmity between the serpent's seed and the woman’s seed. That conflict carries on throughout the biblical narrative — even to Revelation 12:17 where the dragon makes war with the remnant of her seed, and Revelation 21:17 where measurement is made according to the measure of a man, that is, of the angel. These are not metaphorical ideas — they speak to spiritual genetics, two opposing lineages.</p>
  <p>This explains why we feel like strangers in the world. We are not of it — we are from above. The enemy has worked tirelessly to blend the two races into one indistinguishable body, but the spiritual fruit reveals the truth.</p>

  <h2>Part 4: Twin System — Opposing Energies</h2>
  <p>We are born into a snare with two opposing spirits — a twin system. This is the mystery revealed throughout Scripture. From the beginning, there has been enmity between two seedlines, a war within the temple, and opposing forces within man: light and darkness, male and female, good and evil. These energies reflect the inner war that Paul speaks of in Romans 7 — the flesh striving against the spirit.</p>
  <p>Cain and Abel were twins born of two different fathers: one of God, the other of the serpent. Cain represents the carnal, earthly energy — the one who brought death into the field. Abel represents righteousness — the spiritual man, the image of Christ. The entire world system follows the Cain model: competition, envy, dominance, pride. The Kingdom of God follows the Abel pattern: humility, meekness, obedience, and sacrifice.</p>
  <p>This is echoed in ancient symbols like the Yin and Yang — not as new-age ideas, but as representations of the dual nature in the flesh. Male and female, light and dark — not physical gender, but spiritual coding in a fallen system. Only in Christ are these two opposing energies reconciled. He makes the two one. He breaks down the middle wall of partition.</p>
  <p>As long as we remain double-minded and unconverted, we are in a constant war within ourselves. But through the Holy Spirit, Christ removes the corrupt seed and replaces it with the incorruptible. That is the mystery of the new birth. That is what brings peace — the good you and the bad you are reconciled into one new creature.</p>

  <h2>Part 5: Genesis & Elohim</h2>
  <p>In Genesis 1 the Lord God Almighty is not mentioned. The Hebrew word for God (H430) is 'Elohim' — plural, meaning gods, angels, and magistrates of the Supreme God. The Lord God is only mentioned in Genesis 2 when He forms Adam, the first man with a living soul.</p>
  <p>Genesis 2:2 says "God (Elohim) ended His work (deputyship) and rested." Ask yourself, would the Lord God Almighty be the Deputy? No, He'd be the Sheriff. Would He need rest? No, but Elohim, now in flesh, might need a rest.</p>
  <p>These verses suggest a deeper truth hidden in plain sight — that many beings called "gods" (Elohim) were involved in shaping this world, under the allowance of the Most High. This implies that the world system was built not by the direct hand of El — the singular, supreme God — but by spiritual beings operating under His authority, some of whom later rebelled.</p>
  <p>The soul that God breathes into Adam — and into us — originates not from below but from above. We are not just creations; we are offspring. Angels placed into host bodies. Jesus said, "Ye are gods" (Psalm 82, John 10) and Paul affirms we were chosen in Christ before the foundation of the world (Ephesians 1:4). That means God foreknew us — we are not accidents of dust, but divine intentions planted in flesh.</p>

  <h2>Part 6: Inversion — Turning the World Upside Down</h2>
  <p>We are born into an inverted world. The truth is hidden through inversion — good is called evil, and evil is called good. Satan has turned everything upside down to blind the hearts of men. But the true path to God is the opposite of what the world teaches. To see spiritually, you must be turned right-side-up — the veil must be lifted.</p>
  <p>Isaiah 29 speaks directly to this condition. It is written: “This people draw near me with their mouth, and with their lips do honour me, but have removed their heart far from me, and their fear toward me is taught by the precept of men.” They are blind — unable to see the Truth — because they are still operating in the inverted system. The heart must be realigned to God, not by outward religion, but by inward revelation.</p>
  <p>Jesus said in Matthew 6:22 that the eye is the lamp of the body. If your eye is single (spiritually focused), your whole body will be full of light. But if the eye is evil (split, double-minded), the whole body is full of darkness. That eye connected to the pit — the locust connection — must be spiritually cut. If not, the soul is inverted downward, drawn into the abyss.</p>
  <p>This is why conversion is a literal turning — a spiritual inversion. The spirit from above reclaims what was taken below. That which was sown into darkness must be brought into light.</p>

  <h2>Part 8: Conversion Mystery</h2>
  <p>We are born into a snare with two opposing spirits — a twin system. Jesus came to seek the lost and mend the brokenhearted. Ask, Seek, Knock — ask to be made whole again.</p>
  <p>2 Timothy 2 says some oppose themselves. We are double-minded, and only through Christ can the connection to the pit (the worm that never dies) be cut — a spiritual circumcision. The eye that leads to destruction must be cut spiritually.</p>
  <p>Jesus said to Peter: "Flesh and blood hath not revealed it unto thee, but my Father which is in heaven." We cannot be made right with God by anything we do. Conversion is a divine accomplishment. Thank you Jesus, and thank you Jonathan Kleck — a harbinger of the end times. Visit <a href="https://kleckfiles.com" target="_blank">kleckfiles.com</a>.</p>

  <h3>Be Ready for Every Good Work</h3>
  <p>The epistle to Titus reminds us that although salvation is not by works of righteousness that we have done, we are called to maintain good works as fruit of our salvation. It is by God's mercy, through the regeneration and renewing of the Holy Ghost, that we are saved.</p>
  <div style="background: #1e1e1e; padding: 15px; border-radius: 5px;">
  <p><strong>Tit 3:1</strong> Put them in mind to be subject to principalities and powers, to obey magistrates, to be ready to every good work,</p>
  <p><strong>Tit 3:2</strong> To speak evil of no man, to be no brawlers, but gentle, shewing all meekness unto all men.</p>
  <p><strong>Tit 3:3</strong> For we ourselves also were sometimes foolish, disobedient, deceived, serving divers lusts and pleasures, living in malice and envy, hateful, and hating one another.</p>
  <p><strong>Tit 3:4</strong> But after that the kindness and love of God our Saviour toward man appeared,</p>
  <p><strong>Tit 3:5</strong> Not by works of righteousness which we have done, but according to his mercy he saved us, by the washing of regeneration, and renewing of the Holy Ghost;</p>
  <p><strong>Tit 3:6</strong> Which he shed on us abundantly through Jesus Christ our Saviour;</p>
  <p><strong>Tit 3:7</strong> That being justified by his grace, we should be made heirs according to the hope of eternal life.</p>
  <p><strong>Tit 3:8</strong> This is a faithful saying, and these things I will that thou affirm constantly, that they which have believed in God might be careful to maintain good works. These things are good and profitable unto men.</p>
  <p><strong>Tit 3:9</strong> But avoid foolish questions, and genealogies, and contentions, and strivings about the law; for they are unprofitable and vain.</p>
  <p><strong>Tit 3:10</strong> A man that is an heretick after the first and second admonition reject;</p>
  <p><strong>Tit 3:11</strong> Knowing that he that is such is subverted, and sinneth, being condemned of himself.</p>
  <p><strong>Tit 3:12</strong> When I shall send Artemas unto thee, or Tychicus, be diligent to come unto me to Nicopolis: for I have determined there to winter.</p>
  <p><strong>Tit 3:13</strong> Bring Zenas the lawyer and Apollos on their journey diligently, that nothing be wanting unto them.</p>
  <p><strong>Tit 3:14</strong> And let ours also learn to maintain good works for necessary uses, that they be not unfruitful.</p>
  <p><strong>Tit 3:15</strong> All that are with me salute thee. Greet them that love us in the faith. Grace be with you all. Amen.</p>
