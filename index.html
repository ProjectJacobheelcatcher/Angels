    <h2>Part 4: Twin System â€” Opposing Energies</h2>
    <p>We are born into a snare with two opposing spirits â€” a twin system. This is the mystery revealed throughout Scripture. From the beginning, there has been enmity between two seedlines, a war within the temple, and opposing forces within man: light and darkness, male and female, good and evil. These energies reflect the inner war that Paul speaks of in Romans 7 â€” the flesh striving against the spirit.</p>
    <p>Cain and Abel were twins born of two different fathers: one of God, the other of the serpent. Cain represents the carnal, earthly energy â€” the one who brought death into the field. Abel represents righteousness â€” the spiritual man, the image of Christ. The entire world system follows the Cain model: competition, envy, dominance, pride. The Kingdom of God follows the Abel pattern: humility, meekness, obedience, and sacrifice.</p>
    <p>This is echoed in ancient symbols like the Yin and Yang â€” not as new-age ideas, but as representations of the dual nature in the flesh. Male and female, light and dark â€” not physical gender, but spiritual coding in a fallen system. Only in Christ are these two opposing energies reconciled. He makes the two one. He breaks down the middle wall of partition.</p>
    <p>As long as we remain double-minded and unconverted, we are in a constant war within ourselves. But through the Holy Spirit, Christ removes the corrupt seed and replaces it with the incorruptible. That is the mystery of the new birth. That is what brings peace â€” the good you and the bad you are reconciled into one new creature.</p>

    This powerful video from KleckFiles expands on the manifestation of the female energy as death. It reinforces the reality of the twin system and how the world is spiritually inverted.
