  <h2>Part 1: Fundamentals and Scripture</h2>
  <p>This world is inverted. People are so programmed from birth that most ignore the Bible fundamentals. But it’s not simply ignorance — the truth is only revealed by the LORD. As Jesus told Peter, "flesh and blood hath not revealed it unto thee, but my Father which is in heaven" (Matthew 16:17). Only the LORD can open eyes and hearts to see who Christ truly is. Jesus Christ is the way, the truth, and the life. No one comes to the Father but through Him (John 14:6). Daniel 2 reminds us that God is the revealer of secrets — and He is lifting the veil in these last days.</p>  <div class="verse">

    "He revealeth the deep and secret things: he knoweth what is in the darkness, and the light dwelleth with him."

  <h2>Part 2: The Devil is a Liar — and Runs the Kingdoms of the World</h2>
  <p>
    The devil is the father of lies and has been a deceiver from the beginning. He offered Jesus all the kingdoms of the world because they are under his control — for now. Jesus rejected him, revealing the truth. Most of the world is blind to this reality because God has not revealed it to them yet.
    As Jesus said to Peter, "<strong>flesh and blood hath not revealed it unto thee, but my Father which is in heaven</strong>" (Matthew 16:17). 
    Paul also wrote, "<strong>the god of this world hath blinded the minds of them which believe not</strong>" (2 Corinthians 4:4).
    Only the LORD can open spiritual eyes.
  </p>

  <div class="verse">
    <strong>Matthew 4:8–9</strong><br />
    "Again, the devil taketh him up into an exceeding high mountain, and sheweth him all the kingdoms of the world, and the glory of them;
    And saith unto him, All these things will I give thee, if thou wilt fall down and worship me."

  <h2>Part 3: Two Races — Wheat and Tares (Matthew 13)</h2>
  <p>
    Jesus taught in parables to reveal spiritual truth to those with ears to hear. In Matthew 13, He reveals a hidden truth: two spiritual lineages exist on earth — one from God (wheat) and one sown by the enemy (tares). They grow together until the harvest — the end of the world.
  </p>
  <p>
    These two types look similar outwardly, but their fruit — their actions — prove their source. This aligns with the mystery of Cain and Abel. One was righteous, the other not. Jesus said, “By their fruits ye shall know them” (Matthew 7:20). Ask: Do they lie? Do they honor Christ?
  </p>

  <div class="verse">
    <strong>Matthew 13:24–25</strong><br />
    "The kingdom of heaven is likened unto a man which sowed good seed in his field: But while men slept, his enemy came and sowed tares among the wheat, and went his way."

  <div class="verse">
    <strong>Matthew 13:30</strong><br />
    "Let both grow together until the harvest: and in the time of harvest I will say to the reapers, Gather ye together first the tares, and bind them in bundles to burn them: but gather the wheat into my barn."

  <h2>Part 4: Two Great Powers — Christ Above, Satan Below</h2>
  <p>
    The battle is spiritual. Earth stands between two great spiritual forces: the Lord God above — the source of truth, light, and life — and the devil below — the ruler of lies, darkness, and death.
    This isn't symbolic. It's real. Most people are blind to it because they see only flesh. But scripture tells us clearly that our fight is against rulers of the darkness — not against people.
  </p>
  <p>
    The enemy uses systems, governments, media, education, and even religion to twist and suppress the truth. But God gives us the full armor of God so we can stand in the evil day. Victory is in Christ alone.
  </p>

  <div class="verse">
    <strong>Ephesians 6:10–12</strong><br />
    "Finally, my brethren, be strong in the Lord, and in the power of his might. Put on the whole armour of God, that ye may be able to stand against the wiles of the devil.
    For we wrestle not against flesh and blood, but against principalities, against powers, against the rulers of the darkness of this world, against spiritual wickedness in high places."
