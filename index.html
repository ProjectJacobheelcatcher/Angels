  <h2>Part 1: Fundamentals and Scripture</h2>
  <p>This world is inverted. People are so programmed from birth that most ignore the Bible fundamentals. Take them to heart. The devil lies and runs the kingdoms of earth, but God is Truth. Jesus Christ is the way, the truth, and the life. No one comes to the Father but through Him (John 14:6). Daniel 2 reminds us that God is the revealer of secrets â€” and He is lifting the veil in these last days.</p>  <div class="verse">
