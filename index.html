    <p>Wake up to what the scriptures are really saying. The world is inverted. Jesus is the Truth.</p>

      <h2>Part 1: Fundamentals and Scripture</h2>
      <p>This world is inverted. People are so programmed from birth that most ignore the Bible fundamentals. Take them to heart. The devil lies and runs the kingdoms of earth. Jesus is Truth. Ask, Seek, Knock â€” Daniel 2 says God is the revealer of secrets.</p><div class="verse">
    <strong>Matthew 4:8â€“9</strong><br />

  <h2>Part 2: Genesis and Elohim</h2>
  <p>Genesis 1 uses the word Elohim (plural gods/angels), not the personal name of the LORD God (YHWH). The real Creator enters the narrative in Genesis 2, forming Adam from the dust and giving him a soul. This distinction is often overlooked.</p>

  <div class="verse">
    <strong>Genesis 1:1</strong><br />

  <h2>Part 3: Inversion and the Hidden World</h2>
  <p>The Bible reveals the spiritual inversion of our world â€” calling evil good and good evil. This hidden war is spiritual and operates through deceit and darkness. Jesus came to reprove this world with light and truth.</p>

  <div class="verse">
    <strong>Isaiah 5:20â€“21</strong><br />
    "Woe unto them that call evil good, and good evil..."

  <div class="verse">

  <h2>Part 4: Double-Mindedness and Twin Spirits</h2>
  <p>We are born into a snare with two opposing spirits â€” a double mind. Jesus came to make us whole and restore us to truth, to reconcile us with the Father through one Spirit.</p>  <div class="verse">
    <strong>James 4:7â€“8</strong><br />
    "Submit yourselves therefore to God. Resist the devil, and he will flee from you... and purify your hearts, ye double minded."

    <h2>Part 5: Stars, Angels, and Identity</h2>
    <p>The Bible compares us to stars â€” celestial beings fallen into flesh. There is a spiritual war between light and darkness. Many symbols and teachings have been hidden, inverted, or twisted to distract us from this truth.</p><div class="verse">
  <strong>2 Timothy 2:3â€“4</strong><br />
  "Thou therefore endure hardness, as a good soldier of Jesus Christ..."

    <h2>Part 6: Jesus â€” Peace and Unity</h2>
    <p>Jesus is our peace. He came to mend the brokenhearted and unify what was divided. The war within â€” the good you and bad you â€” can only be reconciled through Him.</p><div class="verse">
  <strong>Ephesians 2:14â€“19</strong><br />
  "He is our peace... hath made both one... to make in himself of twain one new man..."

    <h2>Part 7: Spiritual Circumcision & Divine Accomplishment</h2>
    <p>We cannot be made right with God through our own efforts. Being a Christian is not a human achievement â€” it is a <strong>Divine Accomplishment</strong>. It is the result of being <strong>spiritually converted</strong>. Your one eye that's connected to the worm that never dies is <strong>cut â€” spiritually circumcised</strong> thanks to Jesus Christ.</p><p>To know Jesus, you have to turn the world upside-down. Go to <a href="http://www.kleckfiles.com" target="_blank">kleckfiles.com</a> and watch <strong>Jonathan Kleck</strong>, who is an end-time harbinger. The LORD gifted him to us, giving us our hope and faith in Christ. Thank you Jesus, and thank you Jonathan Kleck.</p>

<div class="verse">
  <strong>Matthew 6:22â€“23</strong><br />
  "The light of the body is the eye: if therefore thine eye be single, thy whole body shall be full of light. But if thine eye be evil..."
  <a href="https://classic.biblegateway.com/audio/mclean/kjv/Matt.6" target="_blank">ðŸŽ§ Listen to Matthew 6</a>
