      <h2>🗽 $20 Bill — Twin Towers & Pentagon (9/11)</h2>
      <p>This bill, when folded in two ways, reveals two separate images: the Twin Towers engulfed in smoke and the Pentagon under attack. Both events occurred on September 11, 2001 — but the imagery was printed before that.</p>

      <h2>🔁 Turn the World Upside Down</h2>
      <p>To truly know the truth, you must be born again — spiritually inverted — turned upside down. This world is a lie, and until you are converted, you cannot see it.</p>
      <p><strong>Acts 17:6</strong> — “These that have turned the world upside down are come hither also...”</p>
      <p><strong>John 3:3</strong> — “Except a man be born again, he cannot see the kingdom of God.”</p>
      <p><strong>Isaiah 29:16</strong> — “Surely your turning of things upside down shall be esteemed as the potter’s clay...”</p>
      <p>When your spiritual eyes are opened, you’ll see what’s been hidden in plain sight — and that THE LORD is calling you out of the world.</p>
