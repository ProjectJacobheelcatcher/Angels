    <h2>Part 1: Fundamentals and Scripture</h2>
    <p>This world is inverted. People are so programmed from birth that most ignore the Bible fundamentals. Take them to heart. The devil lies and runs the kingdoms of earth. Jesus is Truth. Ask, Seek, Knock â€” Daniel 2 says God is the revealer of secrets.</p><p>The Bible tells us we are in a spiritual war. We were foreknown by God before the foundation of the world â€” placed in a host body. But due to the fall, weâ€™re born into a system of confusion, spiritually blind, needing to be born again.</p>

<p>There are two seed lines â€” the corruptible and the incorruptible â€” at war from the beginning. Genesis 3:15 says there will be enmity between the serpent's seed and the woman's seed. That same war carries through to Revelation 12:17 where the dragon makes war with the remnant of her seed. And in Revelation 21:17, the angel measures a man â€” meaning the man is, in truth, an angel. These aren't metaphors â€” these are revelations of identity.</p>

<p>Genesis 1 uses the word "Elohim" (plural: gods, magistrates, angels). It wasn't until Genesis 2 that the LORD God (YHWH Elohim) begins to form Adam from the dust and breathes the living soul. We are led out of the Genesis 1 creation â€” Egypt, a picture of the world â€” into freedom by the LORD, just as in the Exodus. Egypt is more than a place. Itâ€™s the world system â€” and salvation is our exodus out of it.</p>

<p>The devil hides truth in plain sight, but when we are born again, the veil is removed, and we see what was always there. Inversion is everywhere â€” good is called evil and evil good. The only way out is through Christ, who restores sight and truth.</p>
