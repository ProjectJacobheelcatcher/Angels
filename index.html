      <h2>The Twin System</h2>
      <blockquote><strong>"A kingdom divided cannot stand." — Matthew 12:25</strong></blockquote>
      <h3>Introduction</h3>
      <p>The Twin System is the hidden spiritual structure of this world—one that operates in opposition to the truth of God. Every human being is born into a dual system: one part from above, one part from below. It’s a system of light and dark, sheep and goats, wheat and weeds, good and evil—all housed within the same vessel. This system began in Genesis with the creation of <strong>two races</strong>: one by <strong>Elohim</strong> in Genesis 1, and another by <strong>the LORD God</strong> in Genesis 2. This mystery reveals why the world feels spiritually upside-down—and why it must be turned right side up.</p>

      <h3>Summary</h3>
      <p>According to the revelation given to Jonathan Kleck, the Twin System is the spiritual DNA of the fallen world. It’s the serpent system—the same serpent that tricked Eve and brought forth a race born of corruption (Genesis 3). This race carries a <strong>corruptible seed</strong> (1 Peter 1:23), in contrast to those born again of the <strong>incorruptible seed</strong> of Christ. We are living in a <strong>battleground between two opposing spirits</strong> housed in human flesh. This is why the Bible says “a house divided against itself cannot stand.” (Mark 3:25)</p>

      <p>The Twin System is exposed when your eyes are opened—literally. Jonathan shows how <strong>symmetry in human eyes, faces, and even architecture</strong> reflects this duality. One side is of Christ, the other of Lucifer. And until we’re born again and fully converted, we remain trapped in this split identity.</p>

      <p>This system is what Revelation 12:17 describes: a war between the dragon and the remnant who “keep the commandments of God, and have the testimony of Jesus Christ.” And in Revelation 21:17, the angel measures the temple “according to the measure of a man, that is, of the angel”—because those born again are restored, no longer two but <strong>one in Christ</strong>.</p>
