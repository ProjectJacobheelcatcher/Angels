  <h1>Part 1: The Fundamentals — Hidden in Plain Sight</h1>  <p>The world is inverted. The truth is hidden in plain sight, yet most cannot see it. Why? Because <strong>God has not revealed it to them</strong>. Jesus told Peter: “Flesh and blood hath not revealed it unto thee, but my Father which is in heaven.” (Matthew 16:17). Revelation comes from the Father — not from study or intellect — but from <em>spiritual awakening</em>.</p>  <p>In Genesis 1, the word for God is <strong>Elohim</strong> (plural — gods, magistrates, angels). It says Elohim created man in <em>their</em> image. In Genesis 2, the LORD God (YHWH Elohim) forms Adam and breathes life into him. This shift reveals the presence of two creators: one plural, one singular — two races, two seeds.</p>  <p>The Bible reveals a <strong>hybrid creation</strong>. Elohim created a host body system in Genesis 1. The LORD God planted His spirit in Adam in Genesis 2. But something corrupted that seed — the serpent. Genesis 3:15 reveals a <strong>spiritual war</strong>: "I will put enmity between thy seed and her seed..." That war carries forward to Revelation 12:17 and 21:17 — between the children of God and the seed of the dragon.</p>  <p>This explains our spiritual condition: a battle inside. Paul said in Romans 7, we are conflicted — the spirit versus the flesh. The corruptible seed wages war against the incorruptible.</p>  <p>Egypt represents the world — bondage, illusion, deception. Exodus is the story of spiritual awakening: God calling His children out of bondage, out of <em>this world</em>. The true Christian walk is not religion — it is being born again from above. That’s why Jesus said, “You must be born again.” (John 3:3)</p>  <p>Until then, we are spiritually blind. The devil hides the truth in plain sight. But the Holy Spirit reveals it, flips the system upside-down, and sets the captive free.</p>  <div class="verse">
